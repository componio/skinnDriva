This document provides information on how to install skinnDriva. All installation parts are 
described as single steps. After completing each step you are strongly advised to verify the 
success of your work. Please note also, that skinnDriva doesn't work with OpenCms versions older
than 8.0 and is tested with OpenCms 8.x and not with OpenCms 9.

1) Install skinnDriva
2) Restart OpenCms

1) skinnDriva consists of 3 modules which are :
   - The commons module "com.diawara.opencms.commons"
     This module is mandatory and provides all library functions needed by skinnDriva. These
     library functions may also be shared with other frameworks.
     
   - The skinnDriva core module "net.componio.opencms.modules.eight.skinndriva.rd"
     This is the skinnDriva main module and is also mandatory. It provides you with all the skinnDriva 
     funtionalities like generic formatters, the admin point, the tag libraries and much more.
     
   - The skinnDriva base module "net.componio.opencms.modules.eight.skinndriva.rd.skins.base"
     This module is optional and provides you with some optional add ons like some resource types
     which you can use in all your skins. If you don't use this one, it's recommmended to create your
     own one, so that you can use the same set of resource types in all your skins. This assures
     that your skins are all compatible each to the other.
   
   To install skinnDriva, please install these three modules in the order in which they are mentionned
   above.
   
2) Restart OpenCms :
   After the installation of the modules, restart OpenCms to apply all the changes to the system and get
   started with skinnDriva. Please find additional information in the documentation, which is provided
   at http://www.skinndriva.com
